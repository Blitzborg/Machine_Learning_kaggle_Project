# Recognizing Faces in the Wild
This project is a part of the Machine Learning course in Nanyang Technological University. The Kaggle Competition chosen for the project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild) 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is was to determine whether two people are blood-related or not on the sole basis of facial images to predict whether by designing a complex model. The data used for training and testing is provided by an image database called families in the wild.

## Project Description
The proposed solution is a classifier using a VGGFace baseline CNN model in Keras with modified architecture to determine if two people are blood-related based solely on images of their faces. 

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning 
* Image Recognition
* Transfer Learning
